# Dataread
A Tk (and Pandas) based solution for reading csv data science files and performing simple GUI-based analysis and data validation on them

Currently it's a little bit rough around the edges; there might be some menu items that don't work.  I'm including filelist.py, a short script for making a csv from your filesystem, so you can generate your own sample data.  (Be sure you check where filelist is reading from and writing to before using it.)  Your filesystem data would be good for testing out taking summaries, doing row subsets, and making probplots to explore data.
